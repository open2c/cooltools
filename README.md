Chromosome conformation capture technologies reveal the incredible complexity of genome folding. A growing number of labs and multiple consortia, including the 4D Nucleome, the International Nucleome Consortium, and ENCODE, are generating higher-resolution datasets to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets increase the challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage, to memory, to researchersâ€™ time. The recently-introduced [***cooler***](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/tree/master/cooler) format readily handles storage of high-resolution datasets via a sparse data model.

***cooltools*** leverages this format to enable flexible and reproducible analysis of high-resolution data. ***cooltools*** provides a suite of computational tools with a paired python API and command line access, which facilitates workflows either on high-performance computing clusters or via custom analysis notebooks. As part of the [***Open2C*** ecosystem](https://open2c.github.io/), ***cooltools*** also provides detailed introductions to key concepts in Hi-C-data analysis with interactive notebook documentation.

If you use ***cooltools*** in your work, please cite ***cooltools*** via its zenodo [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5214125](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5214125)

## Requirements

The following are required before installing cooltools:

* Python 3.7+
* `numpy`
* `cython`

## Installation

```sh
pip install cooltools
```

or install the latest version directly from github:

```
    $ pip install https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
``` 

See the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/blob/master/requirements.txt) file for information on compatible dependencies, especially for [cooler](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/tree/master/cooler) and [bioframe](https://github.com/open2c/bioframe).


## Documentation and Tutorials

Documentation can be found here: https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Cooltools offers a number of tutorials to showcase analyses it enables using the [Open2c code ecosystem](https://github.com/open2c/). For users who are new to Hi-C analysis, we recommend going through example notebooks in the following order:

- [Visualization](https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/viz.html): how to load and visualize Hi-C data stored in coolers.
- [Contacts vs Distance](https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/contacts_vs_distance.html):  how to calculate contact frequency as a function of genomic distance, the most prominent feature in Hi-C maps.
- [Compartments and Saddles](https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/compartments_and_saddles.html):  how to extract eigenvectors and create saddleplots reflecting A/B compartments.
- [Insulation and Boundaries](https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/insulation_and_boundaries.html):  how to extract insulation profiles and call boundaries using insulation profile minima.
- [Pileups and Average Patterns](https://cooltools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/pileup_CTCF.html): how to create avearge maps around genomic features like CTCF.

Note that these notebooks currently focus on mammalian interphase Hi-C analysis, but are readily extendible to other organisms and cellular contexts.
