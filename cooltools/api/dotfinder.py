    pixel is enriched enough to call it a feature (dot-loop,
    flare, etc.) in a downstream analysis.

    For every pixel of interest [i,j], locally adjusted
    expected is a product of a global expected in that
    pixel E_bal[i,j] and an enrichment of local environ-

    origin : (int,int) tuple
        tuple of interegers that specify the
        location of an observed matrix slice.
        Measured in bins, not in nucleotides.
    observed : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains balanced observed O_bal
    expected : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains expected, calculated
        based on balanced observed: E_bal.
    bal_weights : numpy.ndarray or (numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray)
        1D vector used to turn raw observed
        into balanced observed for a slice of
        a matrix with the origin on the diagonal;
        and a tuple/list of a couple of 1D arrays
        in case it is a slice with an arbitrary
        origin.
    kernels : dict of (str, numpy.ndarray)
        dictionary of kernels/masks to perform
        convolution of the heatmap. Kernels
        describe the local environment, and
        used to estimate baseline for finding
        enriched/prominent peaks.
        Peak must be enriched with respect to
        all local environments (all kernels),
        to be considered significant.
        Dictionay keys must contain names for
        each kernel.
        Note, scipy.ndimage.convove flips kernel
        first and only then applies it to matrix.
    balance_factor: float
        Multiplicative Balancing factor:
        balanced matrix multiplied by this factor
        sums up to the total number of reads (taking
        symmetry into account) instead of number of
        bins in matrix. defaults to None and skips
        a lowleft KernelObserved factor calculation.
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        We need this to test how dynamic donut size

        bin2_id - bin bin2_id index, adjusted to origin

        exp.raw - global expected, rescaled to raw-counts
        obs.raw - observed values in raw-counts.

    An attempt to implement HiCCUPS-like lambda-chunking
    statistical procedure.
    Use FDR thresholds for different "classes" of hypothesis
    (classified by their l.a. expected scores), in order to
    extract pixels that stand out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scored_df : pd.DataFrame
        A table with the scoring information for a group of pixels.
    kernels : dict
        A dictionary with keys being kernel names and values being ndarrays
        representing those kernels.
    thresholds : dict
        A dictionary with keys being kernel names and values pandas.Series
        indexed with Intervals defined by 'ledges' boundaries and storing FDR
        thresholds for observed values.
    ledges : ndarray
        An ndarray with bin lambda-edges for groupping loc. adj. expecteds,
        i.e., classifying statistical hypothesis into lambda-classes.
        Left-most bin (-inf, 1], and right-most one (value,+inf].
    verbose : bool
        Enable verbose output.
    obs_raw_name : str
        Name of the column/field that carry number of counts per pixel,
        i.e. observed raw counts.

    Returns
    -------
    scored_df_slice : pandas.DataFrame
        Filtered DataFrame of pixels extracted applying FDR thresholds.

    This is a new "clustering" step updated for the pixels processed by lambda-
    chunking multiple hypothesis testing.

    This method assumes that 'scores_df' is a DataFrame with all of the pixels
    that needs to be clustered, thus there is no additional 'comply_fdr' column
    and selection of compliant pixels.

    This step is a clustering-only (using Birch from scikit).

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores_df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame that stores filtered pixels that are ready to be
        clustered, no more 'comply_fdr' column dependency.

    dots_clustering_radius : int

    verbose : bool

    Returns
    -------
    centroids : pandas.DataFrame
        Pixels from 'scores_df' annotated with clustering information.

    Notes
    -----
    'dots_clustering_radius' in Birch clustering algorithm corresponds to a
