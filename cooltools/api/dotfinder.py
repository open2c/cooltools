Collection of functions related to dot-calling

The main user-facing API function is:
dots(
    clr,
    expected,
    expected_value_col="balanced.avg",
    clr_weight_name="weight",
    view_df=None,
    kernels=None,
    max_loci_separation=10_000_000,
    max_nans_tolerated=1,
    n_lambda_bins=40,
    lambda_bin_fdr=0.1,
    clustering_radius=20_000,
    cluster_filtering=None,
    tile_size=5_000_000,
    nproc=1,
)
This function implements HiCCUPS-style dot calling, but enables user-specified
modifications at multiple steps. The current implementation makes two passes
over the input data, first to create a histogram of pixel enrichment values, 
and second to extract significantly enriched pixels.

 * The function starts with compatibility verifications
    for the `clr`, `expected` and `view` of interest.
 * Recommendation or verification for `kernels` is done next.
     Custom kernels must satisfy properties including: square shape,
     equal sizes, odd sizes, zeros in the middle, etc. By default,
     HiCCUPS-style kernels are recommended based on the binsize.
 * Lambda bins are defined for multiple hypothesis
     testing separately for different value ranges of the locally adjusted expected.
     Currently, log-binned lambda-bins are hardcoded using a pre-defined
     BASE of 2^(1/3). `n_lambda_bins` controls the total number of bins.
 * Genomic regions in the specified `view`(all chromosomes by default)
     are split into smaller tiles of size `tile_size`.
 * `scoring_and_histogramming_step()` is performed independently
     on the genomic tiles. In this step, locally adjusted expected is
     calculated using convolution kernels for each pixel in the tile.
     All surveyed pixels are histogrammed according to their adjusted 
     expected and raw observed counts. Locally adjusted expected is 
     not stored in memory.
 * Chunks of histograms are aggregated together and a modified BH-FDR
     procedure is applied to the result in `determine_thresholds()`.
     This returns thresholds for statistical significance 
     in each lambda-bin (for observed counts), along with the adjusted
     p-values (q-values).
 * Calculated thresholds are used to extract statistically significant
     pixels in `scoring_and_extraction_step()`. Because locally adjusted
     expected is not stored in memory, it is re-caluclated
     during this step, which makes it computationally intensive.
     Locally adjusted expected values are required in order to apply
     different thresholds of significance depending on the lambda-bin.
 * Returned filtered pixels, or 'dots', are significantly enriched 
     relative to their locally adjusted expecteds and thus have potential
     biological interest. Dots are further annotated with their 
     genomic coordinates and q-values (adjusted p-values) for
     all applied kernels.
 * All further steps perform optional post-processing on called dots
      - enriched pixels that are within `clustering_radius` of each other
        are clustered together and the brightest one is selected as the
        representative position of a dot.
      - cluster-representatives along with "singletons" (enriched pixels
        that are not part of any cluster) can be subjected to further
        empirical enrichment filtering in `cluster_filtering_hiccups()`. This 
        both requires clustered dots exceed prescribed enrichment thresholds 
        relative to their local neighborhoods and that singletons pass an 
        even more stringent q-value threshold.

    Get locally adjusted expected for a collection of local-filters (kernels).

    Such locally adjusted expected, 'Ek' for a given kernel,
    can serve as a baseline for deciding whether a given
    pixel is enriched enough to call it a feature (dot-loop,
    flare, etc.) in a downstream analysis.

    For every pixel of interest [i,j], locally adjusted
    expected is a product of a global expected in that
    pixel E_bal[i,j] and an enrichment of local environ-

    between the kernel and a slice of matrix X centered

        -------------- * -------------- * E_bal[i,j]
        bal_weights[i]   bal_weights[j]


    Parameters
    ----------
    origin_ij : (int,int) tuple
        tuple of interegers that specify the
        location of an observed matrix slice.
        Measured in bins, not in nucleotides.
    observed : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains balanced observed O_bal
    expected : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains expected, calculated
        based on balanced observed: E_bal.
    bal_weights : numpy.ndarray or (numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray)
        1D vector used to turn raw observed
        into balanced observed for a slice of
        a matrix with the origin_ij on the diagonal;
        and a tuple/list of a couple of 1D arrays
        in case it is a slice with an arbitrary
        origin_ij.
    kernels : dict of (str, numpy.ndarray)
        dictionary of kernels/masks to perform
        convolution of the heatmap. Kernels
        describe the local environment, and
        used to estimate baseline for finding
        enriched/prominent peaks.
        Peak must be enriched with respect to
        all local environments (all kernels),
        to be considered significant.
        Dictionay keys must contain names for
        each kernel.
        Note, scipy.ndimage.convolve first flips kernel
        and only then applies it to matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    peaks_df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame with the results of locally adjusted calculations
        for every kernel for a given slice of input matrix.

    Notes
    -----

    Reported columns:
        bin1_id - bin1_id index (row), adjusted to tile_start_i
        bin2_id - bin bin2_id index, adjusted to tile_start_j
        la_exp - locally adjusted expected (for each kernel)
        la_nan - number of NaNs around (each kernel's footprint)
        exp.raw - global expected, rescaled to raw-counts
        obs.raw(counts) - observed values in raw-counts.

    Depending on the intial tiling of the interaction matrix,
    concatened `peaks_df` may require "deduplication", as some pixels
    can be evaluated in several tiles (e.g. near the tile edges).
    Default tilitng in the `dots` functions, should avoid this problem.

    All convolution kernels specified in {kernels} will be all applied to the {clr},

    kernel is a small squared matrix (e.g. 7x7) of zeros and ones
    that defines a "mask" to extract local expected around each pixel. Since the
    enrichment is calculated relative to the central pixel, kernel width should
    be an odd number >=3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clr : cooler.Cooler
        A cooler with balanced Hi-C data.
    expected : DataFrame in expected format
        Diagonal summary statistics for each chromosome, and name of the column
        with the values of expected to use.
    expected_value_col : str
        Name of the column in expected that holds the values of expected
    clr_weight_name : str
        Name of the column in the clr.bins to use as balancing weights.
        Using raw unbalanced data is not supported for dot-calling.
    view_df : viewframe
        Viewframe with genomic regions, at the moment the view has to match the
        view used for generating expected. If None, generate from the cooler.
    kernels : { str:np.ndarray } | None
        A dictionary of convolution kernels to be used for calculating locally adjusted
        expected. If None the default kernels from HiCCUPS are going to be recommended
        based on the resolution of the cooler.
    max_loci_separation : int
        Miaximum loci separation for dot-calling, i.e., do not call dots for
        loci that are further than max_loci_separation basepair apart. default 10Mb.
    max_nans_tolerated : int
        Maximum number of NaNs tolerated in a footprint of every used kernel
        Adjust with caution, as large max_nans_tolerated, might lead to artifacts in
        pixels scoring.
    n_lambda_bins : int
        Number of log-spaced bins, where FDR-testing will be performed independently.
        TODO: generate lambda-bins on the fly based on the dynamic range of the data (i.e. maximum pixel count)
    lambda_bin_fdr : float
        False discovery rate (FDR) for multiple hypothesis testing BH-FDR procedure, applied per lambda bin.
    clustering_radius : None | int
        Cluster enriched pixels with a given radius. "Brightest" pixels in each group
        will be reported as the final dot-calls. If None, no clustering is performed.
    cluster_filtering : bool
        whether to apply additional filtering to centroids after clustering, using cluster_filtering_hiccups()
    tile_size : int
        Tile size for the Hi-C heatmap tiling. Typically on order of several mega-bases, and <= max_loci_separation.
        Controls tradeoff between memory consumption and speed of execution.
    nproc : int
        Number of processes to use for multiprocessing.

    Returns
    -------
    dots : pandas.DataFrame
        BEDPE-style dataFrame with genomic coordinates of called dots and additional annotations.

    Notes
    -----
    'clustering_radius' in Birch clustering algorithm corresponds to a
    double the clustering radius in the "greedy"-clustering used in HiCCUPS
    (to be tested).
