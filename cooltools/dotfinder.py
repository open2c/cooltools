    """
    Get locally adjusted expected for a collection of local-filters (kernels).

    Such locally adjusted expected, 'Ek' for a given kernel,
    can serve as a baseline for deciding whether a given
    pixel is enriched enough to call it a feature (dot-loop,
    flare, etc.) in a downstream analysis.

    For every pixel of interest [i,j], locally adjusted
    expected is a product of a global expected in that
    pixel E_bal[i,j] and an enrichment of local environ-
    ment of the pixel, described with a given kernel:

    ::

                                  KERNEL[i,j](O_bal)
        Ek_bal[i,j] = E_bal[i,j]* ------------------
                                  KERNEL[i,j](E_bal)

    where KERNEL[i,j](X) is a result of convolution
    between the kernel and a slice of matrix X centered
    around (i,j). See link below for details:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)

    Returned values for observed and all expecteds
    are rescaled back to raw-counts, for the sake of
    downstream statistical analysis, which is using
    Poisson test to decide is a given pixel is enriched.
    (comparison between balanced values using Poisson-
    test is intractable):

    ::

                                  KERNEL[i,j](O_bal)
        Ek_raw[i,j] = E_raw[i,j]* ------------------ ,
                                  KERNEL[i,j](E_bal)

        bal_weights[i]   bal_weights[j]


    Parameters
    ----------
    origin : (int,int) tuple
        tuple of interegers that specify the
        location of an observed matrix slice.
        Measured in bins, not in nucleotides.
    observed : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains balanced observed O_bal
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        should we switch to RAW here ?
        it would be easy for the output ....
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    expected : numpy.ndarray
        square symmetrical dense-matrix
        that contains expected, calculated
        based on balanced observed: E_bal.
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        should we switch to its 1D representation here ?
        good for now, but expected might change later ...
        Tanay's expected, expected with modeled TAD's etc ...
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    bal_weights : numpy.ndarray or (numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray)
        1D vector used to turn raw observed
        into balanced observed for a slice of
        a matrix with the origin on the diagonal;
        and a tuple/list of a couple of 1D arrays
        in case it is a slice with an arbitrary
        origin.
    kernels : dict of (str, numpy.ndarray)
        dictionary of kernels/masks to perform
        convolution of the heatmap. Kernels
        describe the local environment, and
        used to estimate baseline for finding
        enriched/prominent peaks.
        Peak must be enriched with respect to
        all local environments (all kernels),
        to be considered significant.
        Dictionay keys must contain names for
        each kernel.
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        Beware!: kernels are flipped and
        only then multiplied to matrix by
        scipy.ndimage.convolve
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    balance_factor: float
        Multiplicative Balancing factor:
        balanced matrix multiplied by this factor
        sums up to the total number of reads (taking
        symmetry into account) instead of number of
        bins in matrix. defaults to None and skips
        a lowleft KernelObserved factor calculation.
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        We need this to test how dynamic donut size
        is affecting peak calling results.
        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    verbose: bool
        Set to True to print some progress
        messages to stdout.

    hists : dict of pandas.DataFrame
        A dictionary of pandas.DataFrame with lambda/observed histogram for
        every kernel-type.


    Notes
    -----
    This is just an attempt to implement HiCCUPS-like lambda-chunking.
    So we'll be returning histograms corresponding to the chunks of
    scored pixels.
    Consider modifying/accumulation a globally defined hists object,
    or probably making something like a Feature2D class later on
    where hists would be a class feature and histogramming_step would be
    a method.
