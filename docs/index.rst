The tools for your *.cool*\ s

Chromosome conformation capture technologies reveal the incredible complexity of genome folding. A growing number of labs and multiple consortia, including the 4D Nucleome, the International Nucleome Consortium, and ENCODE, are generating higher-resolution datasets to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets increase the challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage, to memory, to researchersâ€™ time. The recently-introduced `cooler <https://github.com/open2c/cooler/tree/master/cooler>`_ format readily handles storage of high-resolution datasets via a sparse data model.

**cooltools** leverages this format to enable flexible and reproducible analysis of high-resolution data. **cooltools** provides a suite of computational tools with a paired python API and command line access, which facilitates workflows either on high-performance computing clusters or via custom analysis notebooks. As part of the `Open2C ecosystem <https://open2c.github.io/>`_, **cooltools** also provides detailed introductions to key concepts in Hi-C-data analysis with interactive notebook documentation.

If you use **cooltools** in your work, please cite **cooltools** via its zenodo `DOI 10.5281/zenodo.5214125 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5214125>`_


Installation
============

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.7+
- Scientific Python packages

Install using pip
-----------------

Compile and install `cooltools` and its Python dependencies from
PyPI using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install cooltools

or install the latest version directly from github:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip


Install the development version
-------------------------------

Finally, you can install the latest development version of `cooltools` from
github. First, make a local clone of the github repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/open2c/cooltools

Then, you can compile and install `cooltools` in
`development mode <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_,
which installs the package without moving it to a system folder and thus allows
immediate live-testing any changes in the python code.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd cooltools
    $ pip install -e ./

  ./notebooks/insulation_and_boundaries.ipynb
  ./notebooks/pileup_CTCF.ipynb

Note that these notebooks currently focus on mammalian interphase Hi-C analysis, but are readily extendible to other organisms and cellualr contexts.
