# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to act and interact in ways that
contribute to an open, welcoming and healthy community.

## Our Principles

### Assume good faith

Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goals which may differ from
your ways. Give others the chance to demonstrate that they are working towards
those shared goals and are not trying to offend you.

### Be respectful

In order to assume good faith, we must also act in good faith. Be empathetic and
kind toward other people, and be respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, 
and cultural backgrounds.

### Be collaborative

Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback, assistance, advice or
mentorship. Be welcoming towards anyone who wishes to contribute.

### Be open

Preferably use public methods of communication unless posting something
sensitive.

## Moderation

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying our principles of behavior and
will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and partially adapted from the [Debian Code
of Conduct](https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct), version 1.0 and the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html),
